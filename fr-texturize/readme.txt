A quick and dirty plugin to get Wordpress to use proper french typography

== Description ==

fr-texturize does two things:
1. It add non-breaking spaces before “high punctuations” (i.e. :, ;, ?, and !).
2. It replaces english apostrophes and quotation marks with the appropriate french ones.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `fr-texturize.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
